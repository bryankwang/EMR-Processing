## Inspiration  
Accessing and sharing healthcare information is often fragmented and frustrating for both patients and providers. We wanted to create a tool that simplifies the process, makes EMR data universally accessible, and bridges communication gaps between patients and healthcare professionals.  

## What it does  
BAHA (Better Access Healthcare Application) is a healthcare information platform that provides universal EMR processing and user management on the admin side. Patients and healthcare providers each have personalized dashboards that allow them to securely view and edit EMR documents, manage appointments, and streamline healthcare interactions.  

## How we built it  
We built BAHA using **Django** and **Python** for backend logic and EMR processing. Figma was also used in great extent for our design process.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of  
- Delivering a functional prototype with core EMR and dashboard features.  
- Establishing a strong foundation for admin, patient, and provider workflows.  
- Finishing core project functionalities within the allotted time

## What's next for BAHA  
- Adding messaging functionality within dashboards
- Expanding interoperability with more EMR standards.  
- Offering EMR exporting
- Enhancing UI/UX and polishing the frontend
- Exploring security and compliance requirements
